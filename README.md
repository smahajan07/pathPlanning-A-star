# A-star algorithm for 2D path Planning

## Standard install via command-line
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/smahajan07/pathPlanning-A-star
cd pathPlanning-A-star
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Run tests: ./test/cpp-test
Run program: ./app/shell-app
```
## Sample Output

## Performance

In comparison to the pathPlanning BFS repository, this works tremendously fast. In a grid of 250px by 150 px to search for a path from (1,1) to (249,149) the total time goes down from 30sec to 4sec. Further improvements will be done.
